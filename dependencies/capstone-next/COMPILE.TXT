How To Compile, install & run Capstone for Linux, Mac OSX, *BSD and Windows
                        *-*-*-*-*-*

Capstone requires no prerequisite packages, so it is easy to compile & install.



(0) Tailor Capstone to your need.

  Out of 7 archtitectures supported by Capstone (Arm, Arm64, Mips, PPC, Sparc,
  SystemZ & X86), if you just need several selected archs, you can choose which ones you
  want to compile in by modifying "config.mk" before going to next steps.

  By default, all 7 architectures are compiled.

  Capstone also supports "diet" engine to minimize the binaries for embedding
  purpose. See docs/README for further instructions.



(1) Compile from source

  On *nix (such as MacOSX, Linux, *BSD, Solaris):

  - To compile for current platform, run:

		$ ./make.sh

  - On 64-bit OS, run the command below to cross-compile Capstone for 32-bit binary:

		$ ./make.sh nix32



(2) Install Capstone on *nix

  To install Capstone, run:

	$ sudo ./make.sh install

	For FreeBSD/OpenBSD, where sudo is unavailable, run:

		$ su; ./make.sh install

  Users are then required to enter root password to copy Capstone into machine
  system directories.

  Afterwards, run ./tests/test* to see the tests disassembling sample code.


  NOTE: The core framework installed by "./make.sh install" consist of
  following files:

	/usr/include/capstone/capstone.h
	/usr/include/capstone/x86.h
	/usr/include/capstone/arm.h
	/usr/include/capstone/arm64.h
	/usr/include/capstone/mips.h
	/usr/include/capstone/ppc.h
	/usr/include/capstone/sparc.h
	/usr/include/capstone/systemz.h
	/usr/lib/libcapstone.so (for Linux/*nix), or /usr/lib/libcapstone.dylib (OSX)
	/usr/lib/libcapstone.a



(3) Cross-compile for Windows from *nix

  To cross-compile for Windows, Linux & gcc-mingw-w64-i686 (and also gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64
  for 64-bit binaries) are required.

	- To cross-compile Windows 32-bit binary, simply run:

		$ ./make.sh cross-win32

	- To cross-compile Windows 64-bit binary, run:

		$ ./make.sh cross-win64

  Resulted files libcapstone.dll, libcapstone.dll.a & tests/test*.exe can then
  be used on Windows machine.



(4) Cross-compile for iOS from Mac OSX.

  To cross-compile for iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod), Mac OSX with XCode installed is required. 

	- To cross-compile for ArmV7 (iPod 4, iPad 1/2/3, iPhone4, iPhone4S), run:
		$ ./make.sh ios_armv7

	- To cross-compile for ArmV7s (iPad 4, iPhone 5C, iPad mini), run:
		$ ./make.sh ios_armv7s

	- To cross-compile for Arm64 (iPhone 5S, iPad mini Retina, iPad Air), run:
		$ ./make.sh ios_arm64

	- To cross-compile for all iDevices (armv7 + armv7s + arm64), run:
		$ ./make.sh ios

  Resulted files libcapstone.dylib, libcapstone.a & tests/test* can then
  be used on iOS devices.



(5) Cross-compile for Android

  To cross-compile for Android (smartphone/tablet), Android NDK is required.

	$ ./make.sh cross-android

  Resulted files libcapstone.so, libcapstone.a & tests/test* can then
  be used on Android devices.



(6) Compile on Windows with Cygwin

  To compile under Cygwin gcc-mingw-w64-i686 or x86_64-w64-mingw32 run:

        - To compile Windows 32-bit binary under Cygwin, run:

                $ ./make.sh cygwin-mingw32

        - To compile Windows 64-bit binary under Cygwin, run:

                $ ./make.sh cygwin-mingw64

  Resulted files libcapstone.dll, libcapstone.dll.a & tests/test*.exe can then
  be used on Windows machine.



(7) By default, "cc" (default C compiler on the system) is used as compiler.

	- To use "clang" compiler instead, run the command below:

		$ ./make.sh clang

	- To use "gcc" compiler instead, run:

		$ ./make.sh gcc



(8) To uninstall Capstone, run the command below:

		$ sudo ./make.sh uninstall



(9) Language bindings

  So far, Python, Ocaml & Java are supported by bindings in the main code.
  Look for the bindings under directory bindings/, and refer to README file
  of corresponding languages.

  Community also provide bindings for C#, Go, Ruby & Vala. Links to these can
  be found at address http://capstone-engine.org/download.html
